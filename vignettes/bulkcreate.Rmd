```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

It is possible to create automatically reports for multiple cities:


```{r eval=FALSE}
create_bulk(cities = c("Alba Iulia", "Sibiu", "Cluj-Napoca"), country = "Romania")

```
This command creates html files for each city inside the folder `html/country`


It is strongly advised to manually check and fix the automatic categorisation city by city, as there are almost always a few mistakes.

```{r eval = FALSE}
fix_street_names(city = "Sibiu", country = "Romania")
```

Afterwards, you should delete the previously created html files, and re-run the `create_bulk()` command.
